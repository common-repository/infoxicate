Infoxicate helps you get return traffic to your website, by sending out surgically accurate updates to your readers.

== Description ==

Infoxicate helps you get return traffic to your website, by sending out surgically accurate updates to your readers.

The fact is, your readers don't want to read *everything* you publish, they're mostly interested in posts of particular type. For instance, if you publish recipes, many of your readers will be only after veggie recipes for examples, or deserts. Or if you're a techie, many of your readers will be interested in your posts about mobile apps but won't care about industry news.

Infoxicate is a new communication tool between you and your readers. It let's your readers subscribe to updates from your website, but *only* what they care about. So instead of being spammed with RSS, tweets and newsletters, which most users learn to ignore, they will receive emails they will learn to love, because it is never noise.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `infoxicate.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
